# C Programming Langauge

Once upon a time, I was a C programmer. My first professional job as a software engineer involved coding in C. Back then, monitors were still CRTs - not even LCDs.

I still remember my first day: the manager handed me a book about C programming in Oracle's dialect, Oracle Pro\*C. Since my computer hadn't been set up yet, I started reading it. It was hard and quite different from the ANSI C I had learned from [Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/c-programming-language/9780133086249/). Anyway, I kept reading - or perhaps skimming. Eventually, my computer was ready to use.

Then, I started coding in Pro\*C. In those days, there was no VS Code. Notepad++ was still in its early stages. I used UltraEdit to write code, which was a great tool at the time. It allowed me to FTP files to the dev servers, which ran on OpenVMS, for compilation. I can't remember the exact code I wrote now, but I do know that I encountered lots of segmentation faults. It was very frustrating to experience so many issues as a young, inexperienced programmer.

I was supposed to write better C code since my final year project involved using C with MATLAB to detect edges using the [SUSAN method](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~steve/susan/). I spent a lot of time working with the famous [Lenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna) image. But even with that experience, my skills weren't enough to solve the many fatal errors I faced. I had no idea how to use a debugger to analyse dump files. I guessed that some of the issues were caused by null pointer exceptions.

Fast-forward a year, and the company decided to switch from C to Java. That was when I left the C world behind. I moved on to Java and then to other languages. After that, I never touched C professionally again. The closest I got was working with C++ and Objective-C, but even then, I wasn't writing pure C.

Can I try coding in C again? I'm not sure. But I want to give it a shot.

After having many interviews, I've felt frustrated. It seems like I'm still inexperienced - just older now. Maybe it's time to go back to the basics.
